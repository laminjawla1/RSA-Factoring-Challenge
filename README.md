# RSA Factoring Challenge

The RSA Factoring Challenge is a project designed to explore the security and computational complexity of the RSA encryption algorithm by focusing on its factorization component. The RSA algorithm, widely used for secure data transmission, relies on the difficulty of factoring large semiprime numbers to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communication.

## Objective

The primary objective of the RSA Factoring Challenge is to encourage researchers, cryptographers, and enthusiasts to collaborate and develop novel approaches for factoring semiprime numbers used in RSA encryption. Participants are invited to employ innovative algorithms, mathematical techniques, and computational methods to tackle the factorization problem efficiently.
